Description:
Caro Game is an offline web-based game designed for two players to take turns playing on a single computer. 
The goal is to align five consecutive "X" or "O" marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 15x15 grid.

   - "Start Game" to load the game board.
   - "Exit" to close the browser window.

2. Game Page:
   - A 15x15 grid where Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns placing their marks.
   - Automatic winner detection when five consecutive marks are aligned.
   - A reset button to restart the game.

3. Modern and Responsive Layout:
   - The board is centered on the page for better visuals.
